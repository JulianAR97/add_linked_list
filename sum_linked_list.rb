    # For Example, if we have an array = [1], '1' is both the first and last element

Steps
1. Precompute head, add1, root, and last
2. Loop until we reach the end of longest list and add1 is false
3. During each iteration, add values and check add1 flag variable
4. Have our current last node point to an node instantiated with our sum
5. Once loop breaks, simply return root node

Time Complexity
1. Precomputing is done in constant -- O(1) time
2. While loops are done in linear -- O(n) time because we iterate across both lists at same time
and so we 'technically' only have one list of unknown size (other list will be smaller or equal)
3. Computing inside of the while loops is done in contant time
4. Thus, final time complexity is O(n)
